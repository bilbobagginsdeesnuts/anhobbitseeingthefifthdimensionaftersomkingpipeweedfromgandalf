    <h1>My review of the Devils inn, south York</h1>
    <p>It was a raining evening when my train arrived in south York, on the train i was watching the rain and realised
        it was the same rain that I had left from my flat in London, it had followed me all the way north to the small
        and picturesk town where i was to spend the night. Wandering into town i was met with the look of curiosity from
        a few of what i can only figure were the town locals. I figured they could tell right away from looking at me
        that i was the pub reviewer for the newspaper they give away for free on the train and knew that my review could
        be make or break for their town becoming an tourist hotspot for busy londoners who are in need of a weekend away
        from town, but don’t have the budget to visit Europe so instead get on a train and visit the countryside and are
        wanting to know that there will be a pub that’s not one of the many chains they can find in London that’s worth
        their effort to visit. I would later be told it was because i was innedvertantly wearing the colours of their
        rival football team. Tweed and dark maroon was many normal attire of a Wednesday evening so i thought nothing of
        it but apparently the football teams here are more refined then i would have expected.
    </p>
    <p>Arriving at the inn i was welcomed by the proprietor who was welcoming and warm, they also told me that i was
        just in time for a special thing tonight, to say i was excited would be an understatement - i was simply buzzing
        that i had picked this weekend to visit the town, as i had originally planed on visiting the weekend after as i
        had an potential meeting with a book agent lined up for the Saturday night that i was readying myself for, until
        on Friday when i called the firm to confirm my booking they revealed that the meeting was about an email i had
        sent under the rouse of my 24 year old alter ego that i use to contact people with from time to time. Gary is
        his name, his excited to become a jurnolist one day and has sent out many emails enquiring about internships or
        work experience only for me to be seated in the lobby when they are looking for Gary saying that i'm available.
        It hasn’t worked so far but this call was the most upsetting as they had made me and were informing me that I
        had been barred from the premises and would be refused entry by security if I tried.
    </p>
    <p>So i called up my editor Dave, who was annoyed as it was 7:30pm and eastenders was on, and told him that i could
        make a review this weekend and that the 65 pounds would be greatly appreciated. He then reiterated that what i
        submit should be kept to under a paragraph and i chucked assuring him that what i wrote would be a reflection of
        everything that i experienced while at the pub
    </p>
    <p>After the lovely person at the front desk whose name I didn’t catch, or at least didn't remember (my mind was far
        too abuzz with the excitement about the special event on tonight), showed me to my room i was pleasantly
        surprised to find it an adequate room, It had 3 single beds (i admit this was strange) and an pulled out sofa
        bed. I was told I could pick any bed which was reassuring as the sofa bed looked particularly comfortable to me
        after the 7 hour train journey. Not until doing my final room inspection as i was leaving, to ensure nothing was
        left behind - nothing worse then realising you have left behind a lovely pair of slippers, or worse the metal
        shim you use to open your apartments main door - did i discover that there was a door that lead into the main
        bedroom of the room that contained what i was told to be an Californian king. An name that befuddles me as the
        continental United States does not have a monarchy so why does one state have a king? This is the sort of thing
        that i think the editors at the big publishing houses will react well to if only they would take me, im an
        absolute hoot in a conversation i just use Greg as a way to get my foot in the door. Note to self make sure to
        remove the parts where i talk negatively about Dave Or any mentions of Greg. I can't have Dave knowing about my
        side hustle and I certainly cannot have the editors who i bcc in the emails to know about it either.
    </p>
    <p>I took a wander around the town after putting my bags down and unpacking them into the admittedly cramped
        wardrobe the inn had allotted to me. There were a few posters around town talking about the ritual tonight at
        9pm at the inn. The few towns folks who were willing to talk to me were excited about the ritual, the others
        were all too happy to throw fowl language and rocks my way. Apparently I had changed into the colours of the
        other rival football team. I truly must do some due diligence into the football colours of the teams before i
        leave.
    </p>
    <p>After an close encounter with a group of teens and a bakers dozen of eggs i returned to the safety of the inn, i
        was most certain to get there early to ensure that i had a good seat at whatever this ritual was. As such i
        arrived at 5:30pm and ordered a tall glass of wine to go along with the 6 sausage rolls i had purchased from the
        bakery next door. I always find that excitement makes me hungry so i was sure to be ready this time. At about
        7pm i would find myself regretting purchasing quite so many pastries as i had forgotten that the doctor had told
        me that the medication i was on did not react well with wheat. After an unfortunate trip to the bathrooms i
        would come back to find that my table had found new occupants, and all my belongings (those being; my laptop, my
        still undrunk glass of wine, my notebook in which i am writing this review, my room key, my identification after
        the bartender had insisted that i be carded despite checking me into the establishment hours prior and my scarf)
        were now on the table next to the bathroom. Despite there being many empty tables between my old table and the
        one they had now found as a home. I was much to polite to say anything and sta down at the table - thankful that
        my belonging had not been taken, as i had experienced down in Manchester at the Galopogas Inn where my wallet
        was stolen and my bank card used to purchase over 12,000 pounds worth of miscellaneous cheeses from stores all
        over the midlands.
    </p>
    <p>As the time billowed by the inn became more and more packed, and as the clocked ticked closer to 9pm much to my
        excitement people were finally reluctantly joining my table. I was all too happy to have people to talk to and
        more importantly. People to interrogate about what exactly this ritual was. The couple who joined me (i first
        thought they were just two good friends but when later in the night i saw them passionately making out i
        realised that they were a homosexual couple, i of course have no problem with this but think it is worth noting
        for the readers of this fine paper that there is at least one homosexual couple who frequent the establishment)
        were reglaiing that it was their second ritual, and that i would have the best experience if i were not to know
        what was going to happen but instead went in with an open mind.
    </p>
    <p>With that thought buzzing around my head (in retrospect ti could also be that i had skulled my wine upon
        realising that the couple were homosexual, i of course have no problem with them being homosexuals but my gut
        instinct was to finish my drink) the barwoman rung a large bell behind the bar and the room suddenly went quiet,
        besides me asking the couple quite loudly if they knew elton john. Once all the eyes in the room turned away
        from me a low hum started. I for the life of me cannot tell you where it started from but suddenly everyone in
        the inn, myself included, was humming a low hum with an rhythm that just made sense - i wasnt sure if they had
        rehearsed this but we were rather good, i was most impressed with how i sounded and the thoughts of going on a
        reality tv show were vergening in my head before a lound bang startled me back to reality where i now realised
        that the inn was bathed in a deep red light which was again emanating from somewhere that i could not pinpoint.
    </p>
    <p>Dear reader from here i must admit, i am not quite sure what happened. The view from where i was now seated was
        blocked by the mass of most of the town now being in the inn. I was unable to extract details from anyone that
        was in attendance the next day either but i do remember that the following two noises were heard from the bar:
        what sounded like a balloon being blown up, and then a loud pop. After this an chalice was lifted above the
        crowd, it had some liquid dripping down the sides as if it had been filled up to the brim and then filled a
        little bit more. At this point i stood up and had a much better view of the bar to witness the barwoman (i later
        found out they are non binary but i do not know what the term is for a non binary bar tender so i will keep
        using barwoman as they had long hair) taking a drink from the chalice and then passing it along to the next
        person who also took a drink from the chalice. After much anticipation the chalice finally came to me, to my
        amazement it looked as tho it had just been overfilled despite the fact i had just witnessed KEvin take a drink
        from it prior to handing it to me. Without thinking i took a drink from it.
    </p>
    <p>Now dear reader from here i must admit, my memory turns to haze. Im not certain what was in the chalice and
        whether that has affected my memory or if ti was the 8 glasses of wine i had in anticipation of the ritual. I do
        however have a few memories, which in the stone cold light of day i am leading to believe are hallucinations, as
        they do not seem plausible but nevertheless a good journalist reports what occurs even if they sound outlandish
        and even if they can only remember select facts from the night. </p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            A baby was levitating in the air while we all stared in amazement and clapped in perfect harmony
        </li>

        <li>An feeling of restlessness i had felt for the past 9 months was lifted</li>
        <li>I kissed Kevin (the ‘top’ of the homosecual couple who sat at my table)</li>
        <li> A circle formed in the crowd and a couple had an argument of sorts which ended with the husband
            spontaneously
            combusting only to be replaced by dust</li>
        <li>
            I snorted some sort of powder much to the annoyance of some others

        </li>
    </ul>


    <p>The next morning i must admit that the single bed I chose to sleep in (the middle one) was rather comfortable,
        and the breakfast service was excellent. The waiter did have to bring out the chef so that i could explain to
        him what i expected from a poached egg. But after my pep talk the egg was made to perfection

    </p>
    <p>Overall i give the Inn 4 stars out of 5, i will happily vacation here again but dear reader, please do read up on
        the local football teams before packing your suitcases. The youths do walk around town with stones in their
        pockets.</p>

    <h2>Review that was published in the news paper two months later</h2>
    <p>The Devil Inn South york the rooms are adequate, drink selection is vast and the people are friendly. 4/5 stars
